# Book Recommendation System

## Project Overview
This project focuses on building a book recommendation system using machine learning techniques. The system recommends books to users based on similarity and reading preferences.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## Objective
To develop a recommendation model that suggests relevant books to users using collaborative filtering and similarity-based approaches.

## Key Steps
- Data collection and cleaning  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Feature engineering  
- Similarity calculation using cosine similarity  
- Generating personalized book recommendations  

## Outcome
- Successfully built a recommendation engine that suggests books based on user interest
- Improved understanding of recommender systems and similarity models

## Status
Completed as part of Data Science learning and project practice.
